# RPS-Multiplayer

An online multiplayer rock, paper, scissors game themed after a version of the game represented on the popular TV show "Big Bang Theory", which includes two more options (lizard and Spock), which help to reduce the odds that the two players will end in a draw. 

This game requires two players (or two instances in a browser window). 

Inside the code, each player is assigned as either "mario" or "luigi", but this isn't exposed to the player. 

Keywords: Bootstrap, Firebase, jQuery
