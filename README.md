# RPS-Multiplayer

An online multiplayer rock, paper, scissors game themed after a version of the game represented on the popular TV show "Big Bang Theory", which includes two more options (lizard and Spock), which help to reduce the odds that the two players will end in up in the state of a draw.

This game requires two players (or two instances in different browser windows). 

Inside the code, each player is assigned as either "mario" or "luigi", for the purposes of tracking player1 and player2, but this isn't exposed to the player. 

The chatbox is fully functional and scrolls to bottom of page.
